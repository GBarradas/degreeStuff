  <p>&quot;The Jenware onesies were the hit of the baby shower. The custom letter &quot;a&quot; and handmade quality made this gift really stand out among the cookie-cutter clothes from the department store.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Thanks for the cool Jenware barware. I couldn't wait until I found &quot;Mr. Right,&quot; so I just bought a set for myself! My friends always want to know where I got them so I send them to your site.&quot; </p>
