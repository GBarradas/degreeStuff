<h1>The Back of the New $20</h1>

<p>Have you seen the "Series 2004 $20 Notes"? The U.S. Treasury has rolled out yet another revamp of the U.S. twenty dollar bill in an effort to stop those pesky counterfeiters once and for all. It features high-tech fake-busting elements like a watermark, a security thread, and color-shifting ink. It also features crappy design.</p>

<p>I'm not going to concern myself here with a critique of the front of the bill (my friend Jeff says "it looks like something got spilled on it."). It's the <em>back</em> of the note that's driving me crazy.</p>

<h2>Too Many 20s</h2>

<p><img src="twenties.gif" width="90" height="140" alt="20s closeup. If you are not seeing this image, check to make sure the file twenty_20s is in the same directory as this document" /></p>
<p>In particular, it's all those little 20s haphazardly sprinkled in the white space. They are nails-on-a-chalkboard to my visual design senses.</p>

<p>Are they supposed to be another security feature? ("They'll <em>NEVER</em> be able to duplicate this $20... look at those 20s... they're all <em>OVER</em> the place!") Did they let a summer intern at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing design it? ("Hey, let Jimmy try it!") Were they concerned the $20 bill might be confused with a $10? ("What this 20 needs is a LOT more 20s.")</p>

<h2>Connect-the-Dots</h2>
<p>There must be more to it. My theory: the new 20s contain subliminal connect-the-dots messages, like tiny constellations. So, perhaps the 20s connect to form a secret message designed to stimulate the economy ("SPEND MORE") or boost patriotism ("WE'RE NO.1").</p>

<p>I'm not sure I've successfully cracked the code, so I'm asking for your help. I encourage you all to get a new $20 bill, connect the dots to find the message on the back (pencil is best), and mail it to me for review. Together, we can get to the bottom of this.</p>
