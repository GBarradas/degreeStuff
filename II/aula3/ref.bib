abstract = {While DNA's perpetual role in biology and life science is well documented, its burgeoning digital applications are beginning to garner significant interest. As the development of novel technologies requires continuous research, product development, startup creation, and financing, this work provides an overview of each respective area and highlights current trends, challenges, and opportunities. These are supported by numerous interviews with key opinion leaders from across academia, government agencies and the commercial sector, as well as investment data analysis. Our findings illustrate the societal and economic need for technological innovation and disruption in data storage, paving the way for nature's own time-tested, advantageous, and unrivaled solution. We anticipate a significant increase in available investment capital and continuous scientific progress, creating a ripe environment on which DNA data storage-enabling startups can capitalize to bring DNA data storage into daily life.}

abstract = {The market for using and storing digital data is growing, with DNA synthesis emerging as an efficient way to store massive amounts of data. Storing information in DNA mainly consists of two steps: data writing and reading. The writing step requires encoding data in DNA, building one nucleotide at a time as a form of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Once the data needs to be read, the target DNA is selectively retrieved and sequenced, which will also be in the form of an ssDNA. Recently, enzyme-based DNA synthesis is emerging as a new method to be a breakthrough on behalf of decades-old chemical synthesis. A few enzymatic methods have been presented for data memory, including the use of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Besides, enzyme-based amplification or denaturation of the target strand into ssDNA provides selective access to the desired dataset. In this review, we summarize diverse enzymatic methods for either synthesizing ssDNA or retrieving the data-containing DNA.}
